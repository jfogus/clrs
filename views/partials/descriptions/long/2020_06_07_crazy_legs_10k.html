    This is the 12th Annual Crazy Legs 10k Trail Run. The number of runners is limited by the park permit, so once the limit is reached a waitlist will be created. The entry fee allows you entry into the post-race celebration, where there will be an award ceremony, raffle, light refreshments, and coffee. You also receive a trucker hat with a random patch on it. The awards ceremony will be at Dark Heart Coffee Bar in Loveland, CO.
