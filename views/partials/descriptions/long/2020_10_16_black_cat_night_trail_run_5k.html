    In honor of National Feral Cat Day, supporters from around the world are advocating
    for the lives of cats and educating their communities about humane policies, like 
    Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR), that help save cats’ lives and protect all cats in all 
    communities. The Crazy Legs Race Series is proud to host the Black Cat Night Trail 
    Run 5k. Part of the proceeds will be donated to Alley Cat Allies.
