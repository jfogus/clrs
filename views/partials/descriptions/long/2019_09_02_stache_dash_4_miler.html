<p>Come experience the beautiful Town of Porter by running this event. This
  race will be a 2 mile out and back course on pavement streets. We will be
  starting at the Community Center at Hawthorne Park. I am encouraging you to
  grow your "stache" out for this event. If you are unable to grow a mustache
  I will provide you one. Part of the proceeds will be benefitting the Porter
  Parks and Recreation Department.</p>
<p>Each runner will receive a one-size-fits-all winter hat and gloves</p>
