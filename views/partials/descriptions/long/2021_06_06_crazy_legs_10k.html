<p>Welcome to the 13th Annual Crazy Legs 10k Trail Run I am limited to amount runners per my permit so once the limited is reached a waitlist will begin. Covid killed this event in 2020 so onto 2021. All registered runners from 2020 event will be added to the roster so sit back and relax. Any runners that was not sign up for the 2020 event are welcome to register now before to reach the limit. Entry fee allows you entry into the post race celebration where the award ceremony, raffle, light refreshments will be offered. You also receive a Trucker Hat with random patch on it. We will be having our awards ceremony at an off site location that will be determined later.</p>
