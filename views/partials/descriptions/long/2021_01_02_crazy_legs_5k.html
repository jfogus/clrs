    Come experience the beautiful Creek Ridge County Park by running the Crazy Legs 5k Trail Run. The course is two loops around the park. Included in the course is one hill you will run twice. Terrain could be frozen, snow coveredc or dry. Start out 2021 right. All runners/walkers will receive a one-size-fits-all hat and gloves. The start time of this race is 1:00 pm so you can participate in other events in the morning or sleep in and come to this race.
