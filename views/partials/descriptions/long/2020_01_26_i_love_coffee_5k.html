    Start 2020 off right by running through the streets of the Town of Porter, Indiana. I have rented the Hawthorne Park Community Center, so we will be inside for sign ups, packet pick up, post-race food, and the award ceremony. Coffee is the name of the game and that means <a href="https://www.deathwishcoffee.com/" target="_blank">Deathwish Coffee</a> the "Strongest Coffee in the World" of course. We will have Deathwish Coffee brewing and some snacks as well. There will be a raffle which includes Deathwish Coffee items. Time to be <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23fueledbydeath&src=typd" target="_blank">#fueledbydeath</a>. The entry fee includes one raffle ticket and t-shirt. Coffee mugs are also available for an additional fee.
