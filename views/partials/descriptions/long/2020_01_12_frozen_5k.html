    Come experience the beautiful Creek Ridge County Park by running the Frozen 5k Trail Run. The course is two loops around the park. Included in the course is one hill you will run twice. Terrain could be frozen, snow covered, or dry. Start out 2020 right. The first 25 registered will receive a plush animal hat with chin strap. All others will receive a one-size-fits-all hat and gloves.
